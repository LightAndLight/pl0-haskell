# pl0-haskell
PL/0 compiler written in Haskell
Based on the specification from COMP4403 at UQ

Not yet fully functional.

Compiler currently generates code for a stack-based VM. I aim to add more backends later on.

# Installation
`$ stack install pl0`

# Invocation
`$ stack exec pl0-exe -- [inputfile]`
